# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.

=======
# 🏖Xperience

## Functional and technical specification
We are going to create a social media application for creating and hosting events. The name of the application will be Xperience.


### Users will be able to:
- Create an account. 
- Log in and log out.
- Create an event. 
- Delete an event that they created.
- Comment on events.
- See a feed of current events.
- Users should be able to sign up for events.
- User should be able to see who is attending the event.
 
### Extra functionality in case we have time:
- Chat function between users.
- Google maps for location.
- Google sign up/sign in.
- Upload photos when creating an event.

### Client
- React will be used for the front-end of the application.
### Server
- Node.js 
- Express.js
- MongoDB will be used for the database.

# ✉️Semantic Commit Messages
In order to write meaningful commit messages, the following format will be used.

- feat: (new feature for the user, not a new feature for build script)
- fix: (bug fix for the user, not a fix to a build script)
- docs: (changes to the documentation)
- style: (formatting, missing semi colons, etc; no production code change)
- refactor: (refactoring production code, eg. renaming a variable)
- test: (adding missing tests, refactoring tests; no production code change)
- chore: (updating grunt tasks etc; no production code change)
